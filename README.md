# Speed-Dating-Decision-Prediction
This project is about prediction of whether the participant of a date decide to give his/her partner a second date after a short experimental Speed Dating event. I have implemented my own version machine learning algorithms from scratch using python without the use of any publicly available libraries like scikit-learn or scipy.
